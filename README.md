This 2-D tile game was an idea I had based off of a game that I used to play when I was younger that was poorly made and had a huge lack of gameplay. The premise is that you control a crawler in the game that is a certain number of tiles in length and your goal is to become as long as possible. There are other crawlers moving around the board (both larger and smaller) that are played by the computer and you need to eat them while avoiding being eaten yourself! If you expeience a head on collision with another crawler then whichever one of you is longer consumes the other one entirely. Otherwise, if you're able to hit another crawler in their mid-section you can slowly eat them away until they're smaller than you.

In the gif at the top, I'm currently controlling the crawler that begins on the right, while the computer is making moves for the crawler on the left.
